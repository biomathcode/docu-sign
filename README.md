# docu-sign
Hackathon for docu-sign 



For working on the client side (create-react-app)

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

For working on the server side (express)
the start script has nodemon. SO make sure you have nodemon installed globally.
```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

For example perpose i have also added the docusign-node example repo.
